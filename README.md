# face_look_alikee

This is a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to upload a passport-style or similar photo and generate look-alike images. The application utilizes the Segmind API and OpenAI for image generation.

## Usage

1. Upload your photo by clicking the "Upload Image" button.
2. Select the number of look-alike images you want to generate.
3. Click "Generate Images" to see the results.
4. View the AI-generated caption for your uploaded image, along with the generated images.

## Note

If you encounter issues with the application not generating images, it could be due to the usage of a freely available API key, which may have reached its usage limit.
